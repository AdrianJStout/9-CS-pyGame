<li>Game theory has a lot of uses; it's not just for playing games. Today we're going to use it to create and play a game. 
</li>
<li>We are going to learn about a concept called <b>backward induction</b> to solve <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game">zero-sum games</a></b>.
</li>
<li>Backward induction is the process of reasoning backwards in time, from the end of a problem or situation, to determine a sequence of optimal actions. It proceeds by first considering the last time a decision might be made and choosing what to do in any situation at that time. Using this information, one can then determine what to do at the second-to-last time of decision. This process continues backwards until one has determined the best action for every possible situation (i.e. for every possible information set) at every point in time.

<li>To start you off, consider this puzle&#x2026;

<li>"Nim" is an ancient two-player game played with sticks or stones. The objects are divided into piles. 
</li>
<li>The players alternate turns. 
</li>
<li>On each player's turn they may remove any number of sticks from one of the piles, up to the number of sticks remaining in that pile; but they can only take from a single pile on a given turn. 
</li>
<li>The goal is to take the last stick, making you the winner. 
</li>
<li>The strategy element is to make the other person clear out all but one pile, so you can take all the sticks in that last pile.
</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To illustrate the basic theoretical idea behind the Nim strategy, let's first look at a simpler version of the game called "21". 
</li>
<li>Imagine there are 21 sticks in a pile. 
</li>
<li>The rules are: You can take one, two, or three sticks on your turn.

<li>Whoever takes the last stick on their turn wins.

<li>You're going to make your own version of Nim for two human players. 
</li>
<li>We start with a high-level plan; this is written in pseudocode to help work out the sequence of instructions we'll need to code before we start.
</li>
<li>The premise is this:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Store the number of <b>sticks</b> and which <b>player</b>'s turn it is.
</li>
<li>LOOP UNTIL THERE ARE NO STICKS LEFT:
<ul class="org-ul">

<li>Output how many sticks remain.

</ul>
</li>
<li>When the sticks have run out, announce the winner.
</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We can write out some pseudocode to help us think about how we'd write out program.

sticks=21
player=1

<li>Because we broke all the main coding ideas out into blocks (called functions when coding), this keeps the main program clean and easy to read.

<li>If you try playing the game, you'll see there are a few issues.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It's always player 1's turn
</li>
<li>The game doesn't tell you who's won; it just stops.
</li>
<li>You can take 1, 2, 3, -2, 100&#x2026; sticks each time.

<li>By using the rules, we can write an AI that always wins. In game theory, a "no-win" situation is one in which no player benefits from any outcome. This may be because of any or all of the following:

<li>Unavoidable or unforeseeable circumstances causing the situation to change after decisions have been made. This is common in Text adventures
</li>
<li><i>Zugzwang</i>, as in chess, when any move a player chooses makes him worse off than before but the rules of chess means they have to move
</li>
<li>A situation in which the player has to accomplish two mutually dependent tasks each of which must be completed before the other or that are mutually exclusive (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22_(logic)">a Catch-22</a>).

<li>Ignorance of other players' actions, meaning the best decision for all differs from that for any one player (as in the Prisoner's Dilemma).
