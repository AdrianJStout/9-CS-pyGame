- All games have interaction with the user, in computing these are known as Interrupt Events.
- The code that checks if the user has done something is called an Event Listener
- When a specific event is head by the Event Lister
- An action is then performed by the Event Handler code.
  - If we look carefully at the template you will see that the event of the user closing the window is already handled.

- Add the print(event) statement to your code
- Take a look at the interpreter window while moving the mouse and pressing keys.
- Try pressing the ALT key, the returned events are mod:
-  =<Event(2-KeyDown {'mod': 0, 'unicode': '', 'scancode': 56, 'key': 308})>=
-  =<Event(3-KeyUp {'mod': 0, 'key': 308, 'scancode': 56})>=
   - =NOTE - key up and key down are different events=
