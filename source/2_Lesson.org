- We are going to create another shape but in a slightly different way and make it more around.
   
   - In the game setup create a variable =player1X= and assign it the value of 0.
   [[./img/2-1.PNG]]
   - Draw =player1= in the game loop and increment the =X= position by 2 pixels every time the game loop runs.

- Selection one of the three basic logic structures in computer programming. The other two logic structures are sequence and iteration. In a selection structure, a question is asked, and depending on the answer, the program takes one of two courses of action, after which the program moves on to the next event
- How we see it...

- How the computer sees it...

- We are going to use value of the =player1X= variable to determine if =player1= has moved off the screen.

- Instead of making the player reappear lets make him bounce.
- We will need to create a variable to hold the speed and direction of the player â€“ this must be done before the game loop
[[./img/2-7.PNG]]
- We will also need to change the =if= statement

- *Silver:* Add comments to all of your code.
- *Gold:* Create a circle that:
  - appears at  x= 100, y = 100
  - moves to x = 100, y = 700
  - reappears at 100, 100
- *Platinum:* Make the player move diagonally and bounce of all sides of the screen.
